# Color-Builder-Interface
a experimental editing interface using draggable elements

This project is based on a small side project that was tasked upon me at a previous job.
We had these web gui for devices that are used to make device info easier to access then a CLI.
I cant devulge exactly what this was for, but lets say it was to group objects that had been made in a previous interface and saved as that group. I suggested a draggable interface would be cool. So I was tasked with seeing if it was possible. I JSFiddle to experiment and get something working. So now a bit later I am migrating it hear to mess with and see what happens
