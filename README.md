# Color-Builder-Interface
a experimental editing interface using draggable elements thru jquery UI

This project is based on a request that was given to me at a previous job.
Our products stored info that users could obtain thru a CLI or a web GUI.
User can create different types of objects thru this interface. A new interface was needed to group these different objects quickly. I suggested a drag and drop type situaion would be fun, so I was tasked with coming up with a simple prototype. 
I messed around in JSFiddle, and then eventually transfered it over to my own setup. Just made the basics work and somwhat presentable. Was well recieved, but the feature was never given the go ahead and my prototype was sadly forgotten. This version is based on what I learned while making the prototype. 

draggable ui on mobile is possible due to jQuery UI Touch Punch which can be found here http://touchpunch.furf.com/
